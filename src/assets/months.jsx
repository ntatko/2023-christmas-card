                    <p>Juliet and Noah got to spend a lot of quality time together in January while Jess worked as a human incubator. 
                        We would have been perfectly happy lounging under blankets during the cold weather, but Juliet motivated us to keep up with all the things!
                        Finding out about "baby buther" was the start of a many month name debate that went unresolved until the day of his birth. 
                        Juliet learned the 21st century struggle of voice activated speakers not understanding what people really want.

                    <p>It felt sometimes like Juliet never stopped talking, so we tried to make the most of her neverending streams of chatter and made more efforts to record her funny sayings and quotes.
                        She discovered the art of flattery with sayings like "Daddy, you're so handsome," during dinner one night.
                        Some other funny things we enjoyed were when she called things "new-brand" instead of brand-new, and one time when she sat in a puddle and said, "It's very soggy for me. It's very soggy in my lap."
